# Final Project

## Overview of the project:

This project is a combination of different technologies for creating a visualization based on the dataset available from Govt. of Canada websites. This is done by:

- obtaining and storing the dataset into PostgreSQL;
- cleaning the dataset so that there is less clutter;
- piping the data to a machine learning model so that it allows us for further analysis
- from the available dataset, build a prediction model for the outcome variable.
